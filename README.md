# Analyze-Financial-Data-with-Python-Capstone-Project

## Capstone project for the Analyze Financial Data with Python Skill Path.

You are working as a wealth manager at a small firm where you have clients seeking advice on how to invest their money. A young client wants to invest a large amount of their savings in a portfolio of stocks, but they are unsure of what stocks to invest in and at what amounts.

In this capstone project, you will create a presentation that showcases a portfolio of stocks that you recommend your client invest in, and provide the weights at which they should invest in each stock depending on their risk preference.

The purpose of this capstone is to practice accessing and downloading financial data, calculating financial statistics to understand the individual performance of an asset and how groups of assets are related, and how to allocate investments across assets for optimal performance

Compared to the other projects you have completed thus far, we are requiring few restrictions on how you structure your code. The project is much more open-ended, and you should use your creativity. In addition, much of the code you write for later parts of this project will depend on how you decide to implement earlier parts. Therefore, we strongly encourage you to read through the entire assignment before writing any code.

### Import/Download the Data
The financial data you use in this project is up to you. You can access financial data using one of the APIs accessed through the pandas-datareader package or from websites such as Yahoo Finance. Make sure to find data for at least, but not limited to, four (4) stocks to include in your analysis.

Load the data into a pandas DataFrame so you can easily view and manipulate the data.

### Calculate Financial Statistics
Calculate some of the financial statistics you have learned about to gain insights into the stocks and how they relate to each other. What are the returns of the stocks over different time periods? How risky are each of the stocks when compared to each other? Do the returns of the stocks correlate with each other, or are they diversified?

### Optimized Portfolio
Perform a mean-variance portfolio optimization that shows the efficient frontier for the group of stocks you have selected. If the investor is less risky, how should she allocate her funds across the portfolio? If she is more risky, how should she allocate her funds? Indicate multiple investment options at different risk levels and specify the returns.

### Create Your Presentation
We want to see:

* information about the stocks you utilized (industry, sector, background, news)
* the key financial statistics about the stocks and how you interpret them
* a few different portfolio options with the stock weights and why the investor would select that portfolio
* an overall conclusion to the client about your recommendations

### Share your Presentation
1. Save your presentation as a Google Slide or some other presentation format
2. Post your presentation on the Codecademy forum. More details describing how to post your code can be found in the following informational.

Good luck!
